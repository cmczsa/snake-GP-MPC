CasADi toolbox is used in this project. It is an open-source tool for nonlinear optimization and algorithmic differentiation. You can install it on https://web.casadi.org/get/.

Fmincon function in Matlab is also tried. But it is commented out for it took too long to run.

__Main File__

"MPCPred.m".
